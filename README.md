## Unit 0 - HTML/CSS Assignment 1: HTML/CSS Clone via Coders Campus Bootcamp <a target="_blank" rel="Coders Campus" href="https://www.coderscampus.com/">Coders Campus</a>

In this first assignment we are given the task to re-create an older version of <a target="_blank" rel="Brain.fm" href="https://www.brain.fm//">Brain.fm</a> Brain.fm website using HTML & CSS. While using CSS we were given the opportunity to utilize as much Flexbox as much as we could so we got comfortable using it and so we didn't need to get to much in the weeds with dialing in every little piece of CSS.
