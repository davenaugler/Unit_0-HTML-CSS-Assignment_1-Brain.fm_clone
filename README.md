## Unit 0 - HTML/CSS Assignment 1: HTML/CSS Clone via <a href="https://www.coderscampus.com/" target="_blank">Coders Campus</a>

In this first assignment we are given the task to re-create an older version of <a target="_blank" rel="Brain.fm" href="https://www.brain.fm//">Brain.fm's</a> website using HTML & CSS. We were given a few .png and .gif assets to get the project rolling. We had the opportunity to utilize Flexbox so we could get comfortable using it.
